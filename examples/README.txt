pyaeronet Examples
==================

The list of examples will grow, but currently includes a plotting script and a CMAQ comparison. The plotting script retrieves data and creates a time series plot. The CMAQ comparison compares 7 days from the Cart AERONET station to EPA's EQUATES CMAQ simulation.

The examples assume that you have installed pyaeronet:

.. code-block::

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/barronh/pyaeronet.git


After that, you can copy or download the example code to run it.
